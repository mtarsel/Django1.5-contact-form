Django1.5-contact-form
======================

Contact form to use with Django 1.5

In settings.py, I include settings for Gmail and Godaddy email addresses.

This contact form is taken from the django tutorial here:

https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.5/topics/forms/

This contact form does the following:

-User enters their email address
-User enters subject for email
-User types message body
-User has option to CC themselves
